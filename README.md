# Cluster Analysis Tool Manual

Visualize your excel data to make cluster analysis easier!

## Getting Started

1. Create a virtual environment (venv) [Video Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSCzB3zg9A4&ab_channel=StudySession) or [Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
2. Install the necessary imports onto your computer (ex: pip install).
3. Simply run the program with a source-code editor.

## General GUI Flow

1. Choose desired algorithm.
2. Import data (.csv file) 
3. Fill in requested entries (columns to plot, number of clusters, etc.)
4. Press the "Run *algorithm*" to plot/visualize the newly clustered data onto a graph.

## Available Clustering Algorithms

### `K-Means`

### `Hierarchical`

### `DBSCAN`

## Algorithm Parameters

User Entry placeholder text will notify user for necessary input parameters within the program.

## Limitations

This project is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product), and is still in the testing stage with various limitations. More algorithms and updates to come soon.
* Must restart the program to work with new data.
* PCA is used for dimension reduction.
